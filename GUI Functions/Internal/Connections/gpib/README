CHANGELOG:
----------
v0.5	12 Oct 2009	Implemented instrument superclass with subclasses for GPIB and TCP/IP communications
			Added properties and improved object-oriented behavior of class.
v0.4	30 June 2008	Automatically loads the gpib-32.dll during construction of a gpibio object preferrably by prototype gpibproto.m
			Added codeiberr and codeibsta to give helpful status and error code information
			Allow the user to set the size of the gpib buffer during gpibio construction
			Changed display of gpibio objects
			
v0.3	09 May 2008	More elegantly used Matlab class framework
			Added low-level read/write functions
			Changed the class name to 'gpibio' so that the object returned could be 'gpib'

v0.2	30 Apr 2008	Restructured gpib code in terms of a new Matlab class 'gpib'
			Speed improvements in using leaving the buffer as a pointer rather than converting to ASCII automatically
			Fixed initialization code to give the gpib-32.dll an alias rather than rely on Matlab renaming conventions
			
v0.1	28 Feb 2008	First release!!! Most core functions of gpib-32.dll have working wrappers.


USAGE NOTES:
------------
Be sure to unzip these files using the directory structure in the compressed file. The @gpibio, @instr, and @tcpip folders should be placed in a folder somewhere on your Matlab path, but you do not have to add each actual @folder to your path.

These wrapper functions were written for Matlab 7.6 (R2008a). A prototype file that tells matlab the input and output datatypes of the dll is included. To construct your own type:

loadlibrary('C:\Windows\system32\gpib-32.dll', 'C:\Program Files\National Instruments\NI-488.2\Languages\DLL Direct Entry\ni488.h', 'mfilename' , 'gpibproto.m','alias','gpib32')

replacing the paths to gpib-32.dll and ni488.h with the appropriate paths on your system.

For me these were:
Windows\system32 and 
Program Files\National Instruments\NI-488.2\Languages\DLL Direct Entry

If loading the dll by this method fails, the constructor proceeds to load the dll using the header file ni488.h

Example:
-----------
All methods have identical stucture to the standard gpib function calls, but they take an additional first argument that is a gpib class object.

To construct a gpib object use one of the following constructors:

Method 1:
Device = gpibio(0,1,0,13,1,0)
where the arguments to gpibio are the standard ibdev arguments.

Method 2:
Board = gpibio('GPIB0');
Where the argument is a string that you would normally use in ibfind

To close an open device use
Device.ibonl(0);

Besides the standard ib_commands from the NI API I have also written higher level commands which should be quite helpful

Device.write('String to send to device')
Data_string = Device.read;

or use the method that combines both of these to query your device

Data_string = Device.ask('Query String')

Misc:
-----------

I used a lot of the documentation from the linux gpib library. Some of the documentation probably needs a bit of updating.
All the wrappers have been tested, but there are a few functions that I have not included. If you find bugs please let me know.
Either write the wrapper or email me, and I might just help you out.
